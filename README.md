OhanashiGPT is an innovative application that creates custom stories for children based on input parameters such as age and other preferences. What sets this app apart is its ability to narrate these stories using an AI-generated voice that mimics a parent or other loved ones. Additionally, the app generates captivating images for each story, providing a unique and engaging experience for children.


# Childrens' Book Generation App

The app runs as a web interface where you can customize your story settings. Hitting the "Generate Story" button will create a story, a cover picture and audio files that read the story to the user. You can find previously-generated stories in the "Explore" section. Previously-generated stories can be played with a different voice. It is also possible to add your own voice to the list of speakers.  

## Features

- **Custom Story Generation**: Stories tailored to the child's age and preferences.
- **AI Voice Synthesis**: Narrates stories using a familiar voice (e.g., parent's voice).
- **Image Generation**: Automatically creates illustrations that accompany the stories.
- **Interactive Experience**: Engaging storytelling for children, even when parents can't be there in person.
